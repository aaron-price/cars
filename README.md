# Cars

I need to buy a car, so I started collecting data and playing with numbers.

It takes data I collected from a hyundai dealer down the road, plus the first page on craigslist and autotrader.ca
both are filtered to only include cars under $12k, under 200km, and 2008 or newer.

Then, it compares their price to the fair market value, according to motortrends.com, and determines the best deal based on a variety of metrics.

## Usage
```
python main.py
```
